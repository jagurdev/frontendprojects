    <div class="info">
      <p>We make <a href="">Live</a>, <a href="">Push</a>, and <a href="">Link</a> --- innovative tools and platforms tailored for coders and hackers — fostering the positive, original sense of hacking as coding for fun and passion. The company is dedicated to developing software and hardware solutions that empower a vibrant community of programmers, developers, and tech enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1999, Sierra launched Live product in 2001. Today, its offerings are integral to a global network of creative minds who love building and experimenting with technology.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <p>Creating code isn't simple. It demands patience, dedication, and a continual learning process. However, when everything clicks and you're deeply immersed in your work, the sense of achievement is unparalleled.</p>
      <p>This is the ethos that guides Sierra in crafting its products. At the heart of Sierra lies a deep-seated passion for what we create and for the community of coders and tech enthusiasts we serve.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <p>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Monterrey and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Most of us are avid coders, developers, and tech enthusiasts, and many of us use Live and Push every day. Our backgrounds are as varied as our interests - some hold PhDs, others are self-taught, and many fall somewhere in between. This rich tapestry of experiences and knowledge unites us in a common goal: to make significant contributions to the evolving landscape of technology and coding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info">
      <p>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding tools. We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.</p>
      <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info">
      <p>We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate about improving who we are.</p>
      <p>We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>
      <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, our culture encourages collaborative growth and exchange of ideas. Staff-organized development and technology salons provide a dynamic platform for team members to engage in discussions about emerging technologies, innovative coding practices, and industry best practices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info">
      <p>We want our employees to love it here. Since we’re looking for exceptional talent from around the world, we will do everything we can to make your transition as easy as possible.</p>
      <p>If you're joining us in Monterrey, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free Spanish or English lessons. Plus, working in Mexico means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
